# Cloud-application-for-inventoty-Cafeteria-system
Its an inventory system for a cafeteria where the administrator as well as the employees can perform CRUD operations on the Menu. The employees and administrator have different permissions to perform the operations according to their designation. They can also inquire about the count and get to know about the cafeteria history and rules and regulations. Here the database in use is the mlab which is a MongoDB stored in cloud. The application is using JAVASCRIPT, HTML and bootstrap. and the connection is made through Python and flask. 

## Project Flow
An application is built which will store the data in MongoDB database which is stored on a cloud system and perform CRUD operations using RESTful API and Flask. Apart, from using REST API's, we have created user-defined API's as well. Testing these user-defined APIâ€™s is performed on Postman. This application stores and manages the quantity of different item present in inventory. Also, admin and staff have different privileges to access the data. This project could help for:
->Sales analysis,
->Stacking up items in a warehouse or a shop in our case,
->Measure popularity,
->Identify top trends.
